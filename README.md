📖 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Forex market price action using multiple
technical indicators to identify trend direction, momentum, and potential trade signals.
The objective is to assist traders in making data-driven trading decisions
by combining indicators rather than relying on a single signal.

This project is designed for educational and analytical purposes, showcasing
time-series analysis and trading logic implementation.

🎯 Objective

Analyze Forex OHLC price data using technical indicators

Identify trend strength, momentum, and entry/exit zones

Reduce false signals by combining multiple indicators

Demonstrate quantitative thinking applied to financial markets

🧠 Strategy & Approach

The strategy uses a multi-indicator confirmation approach:

Trend Identification

Exponential Moving Average (EMA)

Momentum Analysis

Relative Strength Index (RSI)

Average Directional Index (ADX)

Volatility Measurement

Average True Range (ATR)

Signal Logic

Buy/Sell signals generated only when multiple conditions align

Avoids low-trend or sideways market conditions

📊 Market & Data

Market: Forex (Major currency pairs)

Data Type: OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close)

Timeframes: Multi-timeframe analysis supported

Platform: TradingView (Pine Script)

⚙️ Indicators Used

EMA (Exponential Moving Average) – trend direction

RSI (Relative Strength Index) – momentum & overbought/oversold zones

ADX (Average Directional Index) – trend strength confirmation

ATR (Average True Range) – volatility measurement

📈 Results & Insights

Improved signal quality by filtering trades during low-trend markets

RSI + ADX combination reduces false breakouts

ATR helps in understanding volatility for better risk management

⚠️ Backtesting and performance metrics such as win rate, drawdown, and Sharpe ratio
are planned for future versions.

🧪 Evaluation (Planned)
